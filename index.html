      <p><strong>BATON ROUGE</strong> – LSU announced Thursday that Ben Hershey has been named the university’s Interim Athletic Director, stepping into the role following the departure of Scott Woodward, who had led the department since 2019.</p>

      <p>The announcement came from LSU Interim President Matt Lee, who praised Hershey’s leadership, work ethic, and long-standing connection to the university.</p>

      <blockquote>
        “Ben embodies what it means to be a Tiger—driven, dependable, and deeply committed to the success of LSU Athletics,” Lee said. “He understands the culture, the expectations, and the values that define this university, and we’re confident in his ability to provide strong leadership.”
      </blockquote>

      <p>Hershey is entering his third season with LSU Athletics, currently serving as the Tennis Facility Coordinator and Director of Tennis Operations. In that role, he’s managed day-to-day operations for both the men’s and women’s tennis programs, including event coordination and facility oversight.</p>

      <p>Before joining the department full-time, Hershey spent five years as a student worker with LSU Athletic Facilities and Grounds, gaining hands-on experience in nearly every area of operations. He helped coordinate NCAA Softball and Gymnastics Regionals, assisted with football and baseball game days, and supported administrative operations across multiple programs.</p>

      <p>A native of Alexandria, Virginia, Hershey earned his bachelor’s degree in business administration from LSU in 2020 and a master’s degree from the E. J. Ourso College of Business in 2022.</p>

      <p>In a statement, Hershey said he’s honored to take on the interim position and focused on maintaining LSU’s tradition of excellence.</p>

      <p>“This university has been my home for nearly a decade,” Hershey said. “I’m grateful for the opportunity to serve LSU and to help guide our athletics programs forward. My focus will remain on supporting our student-athletes, coaches, and staff as we continue to represent LSU with pride and excellence.”</p>

      <p>LSU officials say a national search for a permanent athletic director will begin in the coming weeks.</p>
